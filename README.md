# OptimalSurvey
This project is a senior design project in which an instructor can upload a csv file containing their student's netids. 
Once done, backend will receive these netids and return a list to frontend in which a student will choose the top four preferences and top two non-preferences.
This will be sent back to backend where the preferences will be calculated through a point system and group will be made.
The instructor will receive the list of groups in a csv file.
